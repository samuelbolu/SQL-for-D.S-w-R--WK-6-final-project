# SQL-for-D.S-w-R--WK-6-final-project
#Im#agine you have just been hired by a US Venture Capital firm as a data scientist.
#The company is considering foreign grain markets to help meet its supply chain requirements for its recent investments in the microbrewery and #microdistillery industry, which is involved with the production and distribution of craft beers and spirits.
#Your first task is to provide a high level analysis of crop production in Canada. Your stakeholders want to understand the current and historical #performance of certain crop types in terms of supply and price. For now they are mainly interested in a macro-view of Canadaâ€™s crop farming #industry, and how it relates to the relative value of the Canadian and US dollars.
#You will be asked questions that will help you understand the data just like a data analyst or data scientist would. You will also be asked to #create four tables in Db2, and load the tables using the provided datasets from R using the RODBC package. You will be assessed both on the #correctness of your SQL queries and results, as well as the correctness of your table creation and data loading results.
#An R based Jupyter notebook has been provided to help with completing this assignment. Follow the instructions to complete all the problems. Then #share your solutions with your peers for reviewing.
